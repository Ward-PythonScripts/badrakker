GENERAL COMMENTS
Use many batches, 3 is very little and could negatively affect the training of the data
images at a resolution of 1260 is pretty much impossible, way too much ram needed. 16+2 of this laptop wasn't enough


to train:
python train.py --epochs 100 --data custom-database.yml --weights yolov5m.pt

python train.py --epochs 100 --batch-size 3 --data custom-database.yml --weights yolov5m.pt
"din't overfit -> go for more epochts maybe 300"
"batch-size should be as big as possible"
"image should be set to 1280, maybe it can recognize the shuttle easier then"

python train.py --epochs 300 --batch-size 16 --img 640 --data custom-database.yml --workers 2 --weights yolov5m.pt
#Crashed
python train.py --epochs 300 --batch-size 10 --img 640 --data custom-database.yml --workers 2 --weights yolov5m.pt  
#Worked
however, shuttle still not recognized often enough. Did quite well with the training data though, maybe should receive more
images with shuttles, also background images are recommended
